Build Awesome Command-Line Applications With Python
===================================================

Python is a great language for writing command-line tools - which is why so
much of Linux is secretly written in Python these days. Unfortunately, what
starts as a simple script can quickly get out of hand as more features are
added and more people start using it!

The book will consist of a tour through various useful libraries and practical
code showing how each can be used, and include advice on how to best structure
simple and complex command-line tools.
